!!!All runs under 40 are based on false hops, where the imaginary part is registered as real part.
!!!Also for These runs, the hoplist contains some hops, that are counted twice.

1-9:	No Nesterov Term, abs() Metric
	"runs_1to9"

10,11:	No Nesterov Term, **2 Metric
	"runs10_11"

12-13,	Nesterov Term, **2 Metric
15-25	"Nesterovruns"

###!!!! runs 1-25 are all wrong because of ignoring j

26-	Optuna parameter optimization runs, Nesterov Term, **2 Metric
	"optunaruns"

40-	Final runs, Nesterov Term, **2 Metric, no mistake in hoppings, no double counted hoppings
