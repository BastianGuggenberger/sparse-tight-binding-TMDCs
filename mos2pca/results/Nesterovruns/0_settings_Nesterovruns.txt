Errorfunction:

N = sum(math.sqrt(abs(xi)) for xi in x)
    H = sum(xi ** 6 for xi in x)
    
    ef = lambda_0 *metric(ideal_cell,currentcell) + lambda_1*N + lambda_2*H


Metric:

currenterror = (bands[0][j,i]-bands[1][j,i])**2


All runs are done using Nesterov Gradient descent with Gamma = 0.3
The only difference lies in the factors of the ef, lambda_0 and lambda_1


run 12:
	lambda_0 = 2.5
	lambda_1 = 20

run 13:
	lambda_0 = 3.5
	lambda_1 = 15

run 14:
	lambda_0 = 8.5
	lambda_1 = 8
	Metric diverges, because of "aufschaukeln" in the Gradient descent

run 15:
	lambda_0 = 4.5
	lambda_1 = 4
