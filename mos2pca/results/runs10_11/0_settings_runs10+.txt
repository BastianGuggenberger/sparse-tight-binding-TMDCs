Errorfunction:

N = sum(math.sqrt(abs(xi)) for xi in x)
    H = sum(xi ** 6 for xi in x)
    
    ef = lambda_0 *metric(ideal_cell,currentcell) + lambda_1*N + lambda_2*H


Metric:

currenterror = (bands[0][j,i]-bands[1][j,i])**2


run 10 is a simple Gradient descent without nesterov.
From 11+ i am working with nesterov Gradient descent.
